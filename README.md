### Disclaimer
This guide focuses on Pi-OS64 with desktop (*not* the lite version). If you choose to pick any other Linux distribution, especially a non Debian based one, chances are that you will encounter minor issues (minor at best). 
In that case, you need to rely on your own skill to navigate through each step and adapt them to your setup!
